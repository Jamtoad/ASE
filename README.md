## Why All Seeing Eye?
ASE is your power house for all things Functional Reactive. If you've never heard
of Functional Reactive Programming I highly suggest you check out [RxJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io/).
You can also check out [RxNevermore](https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Rx/).
ASE takes heavy inspiration from the both of these.

## What is Functional Reactive Programming?
If you've ever heard of either Functional Programming or Reactive Programming
than you're already half way there. FRP is basically these two paradigms mashed
together. We combine the immutability and lack of side effects from Functional
then the reactive nature from Reactive. State is **transformed** through a series
of operations and then you **react** to the final state.

Learning FRP is **hard** but the payoff is amazing. The easiest way to think
about this is by thinking of water pipes. The water starts at one end and then
throughout the piping system it changes, maybe you dial back the flow or maybe
you change the direction of the water. Once the water reaches the end of the pipe
its then caught and you **react** to this final state of the water.
